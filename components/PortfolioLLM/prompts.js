While searching for a role as a full time developer, I accepted a 6 month contract to teach a cohort at General Assembly as a lead instructor. I leveraged my deep coding expertise to educate adult learners, reflecting a level of understanding that comes from extensive hands-on experience. The curriculum I delivered covered the basics of full stack development using javascript all the way to advanced react concepts. I also covered the basics of Python using Flask along with Go and Fiber.
I showcased my in-depth knowledge through a teaching style that blended dynamic presentations with interactive labs, providing a project-based learning experience that highlighted real-world applications.
Most of my time was committed to hands-on instruction, meticulously planning lessons that were rich with coding tasks and practical exercises to demonstrate the principles taught.
